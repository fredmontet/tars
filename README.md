Tars
====

Welcome to the repository of Tars; a small trading bot made for research 
purposes. If you do invest with it, make it with care. ;-)

Prerequisites
-------------

The code is structured following the Cookiecutter data science template. Visit 
https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/ to become familiar with 
it.

Dependencies are managed with `pipenv`, install it following the informations
available on https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/.

Getting Started
---------------

Once you installed the dependencies with 

    pipenv install

start your Jupyter Lab with

    jupyter lab

and check the getting started notebook in 

    notebooks/getting-started.ipynb

and try to run it. If it does not work, it's probably because of the 
dependencies. In this case, you can try to install Tars with `pip` with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Once it works, take a visit in the `notebooks/tutorials`folder for more.

Have fun!
